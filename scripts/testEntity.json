## 2 Executive Summary

* All environmental & operational permits **secured for 2008-2013**; clear pathway for remaining approvals.  
* Phased ramp-up aligns with Rio Tinto strategy, limiting early capital exposure.  
* **NPV (8 % DR):** robust under all sensitivity cases.  
* **IRR:** ≈ 15 % (> 12 % hurdle).  
* **CAPEX:** ~US $500 M (initial); **OPEX:** competitive vs peer set.  
* Break-even reached within **5 years** of first production.  
* 20-year LOM based on reserve models and optimisation studies.

## 3 Finance

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Discount rate (base)** | 10 % | Risk-adjusted, industry standard |
| **NPV (10 %)** | See sensitivities | Positive in all modelled cases |
| **IRR** | > Company hurdle | Surpasses 12 % |
| **CAPEX** | US $300 M (detail); US $500 M (total incl. contingency) | 10 % contingency applied |
| **OPEX** | US $50 /t | Benchmarked to peers |
| **Break-even volume** | 3 Mt pa | Modelled via scenario analysis |
| **Market share uplift** | +5 % | Via pricing & supply strategy |

Sensitivity work confirms resilience to price, FX and cost shocks.

## 4 Strategic Alignment

* Tier-1 brownfield expansion within **Rio Tinto Aluminium – Weipa** hub.  
* Supports corporate goals of reserve replacement, portfolio optimisation and ESG leadership.  
* Leverages existing **port & road** infrastructure; captures ~10 % additional market share.  
* Aligns with Rio Tinto’s **Environmental & Communities Standards** and “**The Way We Work**”.

---

## 5 Regulatory & Approvals

**Federal**

* EPBC Act approvals (Commonwealth waters & MNES).  
* Sea Dumping Act consent for marine works.

**State (Queensland)**  

* SDPWO Act coordination; QLD EPA licences for Environmentally Relevant Activities.  
* Design acceptance from EPA; Coordinator-General oversight.

**Stakeholder Framework**

* WCCCA provides consultation & social-licence structure.  
* Ongoing EIS (initiated 2008) with Matrix+ (EIS), Hydrobiology (water), cultural heritage teams.

---

## 6 Business Structure

* **Entity:** Rio Tinto Alcan (**100 % ownership**; no JVs).  
* **Leases:** ML7024 (allows tidal wharf works), ML6024 (restricted harbour rights).  
* Clear governance, IP, and decision-rights matrix; balanced capital structure and diversified funding.

## 7 Resource & Reserve Statement

| Category | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade % Al₂O₃ | Contained Metal (Mt) | Cut-off % | Density (t/m³) | Confidence | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Measured** | 100 | 45.0 | 45 | 30.5 | — | High | Dense drill grid |
| **Indicated** | 200 | 42.5 | 85 | 30.5 | — | Moderate | Geo-model validated |
| **Inferred** | 50 | 40.0 | 20 | 30.5 | — | Low | More drilling required |
| **Proven** | 80 | 44.0 | 35 | 30.5 | — | High | Core sampled |
| **Probable** | 120 | 43.0 | 52 | 30.5 | — | Moderate | Reserve models |

Resource estimation follows **JORC 2012** guidelines using block-modelling and geostatistical validation.

## 8 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk Class | Key Exposure | Mitigation |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **III–IV (High)** | Marine Protected Areas; EPBC-listed species | Route optimisation, offset plans |
| | Catastrophic outload failure | Redundant design; regular NDT |
| | Demand volatility (China) | Diversified offtake; price hedging |
| **II (Moderate)** | Ground conditions / mobility | Bearing-capacity testing & design margins |
| | Weather delays | Historical weather analytics; berth redundancy |
| **I (Low)** | Community relations | WCCCA engagement & benefit sharing |

Risk register reviewed quarterly; owners assigned and residual risk tracked.

## 9 Development Options & Decision Rationale

| Scenario | CAPEX | NPV | IRR | LOM | Key Finding |
|----------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|
| **5 Mt pa** | Base case | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | 20 y | Meets strategic goals w/ lowest risk |
| 10 Mt pa | +30 % | ↑ | ↑ | 18 y | Higher value but larger exposure |
| 15 Mt pa | +60 % | Highest | Highest | 16 y | Best NPV but cap-intensive |

Decision matrix (weighted criteria) selected **5 Mt pa** as preferred, balancing value with risk & capital discipline.

---

## 10 Technical Overview

* **Mining:** open-pit, truck-shovel fleet sized via equipment optimisation; 95 % recovery assumption.  
* **Processing:** proven bauxite beneficiation; technology trade-off favoured cost-efficient, low-complexity option.  
* **Infrastructure:** 50 MW power plant, 100 km water pipeline, port upgrades (ML7024).  
* **Geotechnical:** stable Proterozoic host; UCS ≈ 150 MPa; minimal seismicity.

---

## 11 Assumptions & Validation

| Domain | Key Assumption | Validation |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Market | US $50/t bauxite | Historical trends, expert consensus |
| Discount Rate | 10 % | WACC + risk premium |
| Inflation/Escalation | 2 % CPI | Gov-data & Rio Tinto forecasts |
| Recovery | 95 % | Pilot trials & operational benchmarks |

Sensitivity tests (+/- 20 %) show NPV robustness; contingency plans in place.
