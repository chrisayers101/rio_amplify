Project Snapshot\n\n| Item | Detail |\n|---|---|\n| **Location** | Weipa, Western Cape York, QLD (Australia) |\n| **Leases** | Andoom – Special Bauxite Mining Lease ML7024 (plus ML6024) |\n| **Development Window** | 2008–2020 (baseline 2008–2013) |\n| **Mine Life** | ~20 years |\n| **Mining Method** | Open-pit; truck-and-shovel |\n| **Target Market** | China primary; global demand supports base case |\n| **Regulatory Regime** | EPBC Act; Water Resources Act; Sea Dumping Act; QLD EPA & SDPWO Act |\n| **Key Agreements** | Western Cape Communities Co‑existence Agreement (WCCCA) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Executive Summary\n\n- Environmental and operational approvals substantially secured (2008–2013); clear pathway for remaining permits.\n- Phased ramp-up aligns with portfolio strategy; limits early capital exposure.\n- NPV (10% DR) remains positive across modeled sensitivities.\n- IRR ~15% (>12% hurdle).\n- CAPEX ~US$500M initial; OPEX competitive versus peers.\n- Break-even targeted within five years of first production.\n- 20-year LOM supported by current reserve models and optimization studies.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Finance\n\n| Metric | Value | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Discount rate (base) | 10% | Risk-adjusted |\n| NPV (10%) | Positive | See sensitivities |\n| IRR | ~15% | Above hurdle |\n| CAPEX | US$300M (detail), US$500M total incl. contingency | 10% contingency |\n| OPEX | US$50/t | Benchmarked to peers |\n| Break-even volume | 3 Mtpa | Scenario analysis |\n\nSensitivity analysis indicates resilience to price, FX, and cost shocks.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Strategic Alignment\n\n- Tier‑1 brownfield expansion in Rio Tinto Aluminium – Weipa hub.\n- Supports goals for reserve replacement, portfolio optimization, and ESG leadership.\n- Leverages existing port and road infrastructure; ~10% incremental share capture potential.\n- Aligns with Rio Tinto Environmental & Communities Standards and The Way We Work.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Regulatory & Approvals\n\n**Federal**\n\n- EPBC Act approvals (Commonwealth waters and MNES).\n- Sea Dumping Act consent for marine works.\n\n**State (Queensland)**\n\n- SDPWO Act coordination; QLD EPA licenses for Environmentally Relevant Activities.\n- Coordinator‑General oversight; design acceptances obtained.\n\n**Stakeholder Framework**\n\n- WCCCA provides engagement and social‑license structure.\n- EIS program (initiated 2008) with specialist providers across environment and heritage.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Business Structure\n\n- Entity: Rio Tinto Alcan (100% ownership; no JVs).\n- Leases: ML7024 (tidal wharf works), ML6024 (harbor rights).\n- Clear governance and decision rights; balanced capital structure and diversified funding.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Resources & Reserves\n\n| Category | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade % Al₂O₃ | Contained Metal (Mt) | Cut‑off % | Density (t/m³) | Confidence | Notes |\n|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|\n| Measured | 100 | 45.0 | 45 | 30.5 | — | High | Dense drill grid |\n| Indicated | 200 | 42.5 | 85 | 30.5 | — | Moderate | Geo‑model validated |\n| Inferred | 50 | 40.0 | 20 | 30.5 | — | Low | Further drilling required |\n| Proven | 80 | 44.0 | 35 | 30.5 | — | High | Core sampled |\n| Probable | 120 | 43.0 | 52 | 30.5 | — | Moderate | Reserve models |\n\nEstimation follows JORC 2012 guidance with block modeling and geostatistical validation.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Risks & Mitigations\n\n| Risk Class | Key Exposure | Mitigation |\n|---|---|---|\n| High (III–IV) | Marine Protected Areas; EPBC‑listed species | Route optimization; offsets |\n| High (III–IV) | Outload equipment failure | Redundant design; regular NDT |\n| High (III–IV) | Demand volatility (China) | Diversified offtake; price hedging |\n| Moderate (II) | Ground conditions / mobility | Bearing‑capacity testing; design margins |\n| Moderate (II) | Weather delays | Historical weather analytics; berth redundancy |\n| Low (I) | Community relations | WCCCA engagement; benefit sharing |\n\nRisk register reviewed quarterly; owners assigned and residual risk tracked.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Development Options & Decision Rationale\n\n| Scenario | CAPEX | NPV | IRR | LOM | Key Finding |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 5 Mtpa | Base case | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | 20 y | Meets strategic goals with lower risk |\n| 10 Mtpa | +30% | ↑ | ↑ | 18 y | Higher value but larger exposure |\n| 15 Mtpa | +60% | Highest | Highest | 16 y | Best NPV but capital‑intensive |\n\nWeighted decision matrix indicates 5 Mtpa preferred, balancing value and risk.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Technical Overview\n\n- Mining: open‑pit; truck‑shovel fleet sized via optimization; ~95% recovery.\n- Processing: proven bauxite beneficiation; low‑complexity, cost‑efficient configuration.\n- Infrastructure: 50 MW power, 100 km water pipeline, port upgrades (ML7024).\n- Geotechnical: stable host; UCS ~150 MPa; minimal seismicity.\n\n---\n\n## 11. Assumptions & Validation\n\n| Domain | Key Assumption | Validation |\n|---|---|---|\n| Market | US$50/t bauxite | Historical trends; expert consensus |\n| Discount rate | 10% | WACC + risk premium |\n| Inflation | 2% CPI | Government data and internal forecasts |\n| Recovery | 95% | Pilot trials; benchmarks |\n\nSensitivity tests (±20%) show robust NPV; contingency plans in place.\n\n---\n\n## 12.
